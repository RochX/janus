# Janus
Adds a new planet to Factorio: Space Age called Janus, featuring a constantly shifting resource that is difficult to handle and a restrictive spatial constraint for building your factory.

## Disclaimer
This is my first mod and many things are still work in progress.
I'm not a graphic designer or an artist so currently many graphics are placeholder.

Mod thumbnail and planet icon were generated with AI tools.
Hopefully it'll be better art created by a real person soonTM.

If you have any suggestions or ideas feel free to open an issue on GitHub [here](https://github.com/RochX/janus/issues).
